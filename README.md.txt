This is a User Storage.

It's a very simple application with simple HTML design for the user to storage accounts. Here's how it works.

The user can iteract with the application through 4 functionality. Add, Modify, Delete and Search.

Features:
* Add Button =>
The user inputs 4 values that are: Username, Name, Surname and eMail.
The application will check if User and eMail already exists and also will check if the email could be legit, by checking the presence in the input text of "@" and "." characters.

* Modify Button =>
The user inputs the identity of the record to Modify, then the application will display the value of the record to modify. It will be displayed a new button that Confirms the modified values and that will confirm the operation of Modify.

* Delete Button => 
The user inputs the identity of the record to Delete, then the application will display a new button for confirm and then will delete the record from the webpage.

* Search Button =>
The user inputs any part of the Username, Name, Surname or Email. It could also Search any record by typing the Identity Value of the Record. The application will display any record containing the text in input by the user. If the user types more than one text in input (for example by searching an User "Yu" and an email ".it") the application will display only the results that satisfies both the search fields in input.

***Search Button does not work currently. It is displayed, but not implemented***
